| Team meetings generally begin late.                                                                                                                                                      |         |           |   X   |
| Members often arrive late, leave early, or never even show up for the meetings.                                                                                                          |         |           |   X   |
| No agenda existsâ€”members simply have a vague notion of what they want to accomplish.                                                                                                     |         |           |   X   |
| One or two members monopolize discussion throughout the meeting.                                                                                                                         |         |           |   X   |
| Members have not read the assignment, performed the necessary background research, or done what they were expected to do. Consequently, individuals are poorly prepared for the meeting. |         |           |   X   |
| With words or by appearance, some members clearly convey that they would rather be elsewhere.                                                                                            |         |           |   X   |
| Members constantly interrupt each other or talk in pairs without listening to the individual who has the floor.                                                                          |         |           |   X   |
| Issues never get resolved, only put on the back burner until next time.                                                                                                                  |         |           |   X   |
| No follow-up action plan is developed. Members are confused with regard to what the next step is and who is responsible for performing it.                                               |         |           |   X   |
| The same individual or individuals end up doing the majority of the work. The meetings run on and on and on with little to show for the time spent on them.                              |         |           |   X   |
| Assignments are not completed on time or are completed poorly.                                                                                                                           |         |           |   X   |
