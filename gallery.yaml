  Our project is a multiplayer chess interface. Currently, we have implemented 
  a functional program for a a game (or multiple) of chess. Two players are able 
  to play a game using the same computer. Moves will be inputted via text, and 
  the output of the chessboard will be updated after each move. We also support 
  the following popular variants: 3-check, King of the Hill, and Fischer Random.
